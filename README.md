# Scrumdinger

(Work in progress)

Apple's SwiftUI Essentials Series

An iOS app that helps users manage their daily scrums. To help keep scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that users can refer to later.
